      <p>Hello, my name is Daniel and I am a front-end Web developer.</p>

       <p> I am a Web Developer currently enrolled in Thinkful's Engineering Flex Bootcamp. Coding just happens to be my passion. It's the one place I can let my creativity and logic work together in solving problems of all kinds. The ability to program applications and keep them running smoothly is where I spend most of my days. 
        If I am not expressing and challenging myself through code you can find me reading abstract philosophical ideas or writing about them on Medium. Otherwise, I would be on a mountain bike traveling through California's wonderful mountain ranges. I would like to experience, learn, and give as much as I can in this life. </p>
